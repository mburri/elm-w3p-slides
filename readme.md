## w3p-kafi - elm presentation slides

Slides for the w3p-kafi (2017-01-17) at [Puzzle ITC](http://www.puzzle.ch)

The slides are written in markdown (but embeded in the main module as "code"...)

I created a simple presentation "framework" as preparation for this talk.

In order to run the presentation, you have to install elm and npm/ yarn.

```
npm install -g elm
npm install
npm start
```

use the arrow keys to navigate
